One of the areas of teaching in the MSIS program will be that of data science, so in preparation for that content I'm reading through a book and wanted to put my notes here. Hopefully this will be of help to someone else, too, who is starting this journey towards understanding this field :)

## Data Science
*Data science* is the art of wrangling data (which is ever increasing from sensors and our phones and online interactions), to make all the data useful, to predict future behavior, uncover patterns for actionable behavior, and uncover meaning from this mass of data. It is *the practice of using a set of analytical techniques and methodologies to derive and communicate valuable and actionable insights from raw data, to be more precise* :)

Data science produces **data insights** - actionable, data-informed conclusions or predictions that you can use for business decisions. These insights are being increasingly demanded, from Uber passengers and pick-up times, to Amazon recommended (accurate) picks for shopping. 

**Data engineers** work to capture and collate large volumes of *big data* that doesn't fit conventional db systems due to size, or unstructured types of data, or because the input is so fast. **Data scientists** work to actually analyze that data for insights. The data scientist has to *query* data, most often using *SQL* to do so. You can use a variety of formats:
- *CSV files*
- *Python* or *R* programming scripts
- *Application files* such as Excel
- *Web based* such as *D3.js*
