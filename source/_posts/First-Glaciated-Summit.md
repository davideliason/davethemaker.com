I completed the BCEP mountaineering course as taught by the Mazamas club in Portland, OR back in 2015, and was that ever a great course! But, I didn't climb at all last year, and so this year I was bound and determined to get some gravel under my boots! 

So, off I went for a weekend down in the Bend area, just incredible weather, sunny, not hot, no mosquitoes, no rain, just perfect.

I wound up parking at the trailhead late at night ,sleeping in the back of the Element (quite comfortable, by the way), and then heading up the trail before it was even light- using my headlamp, I had to dodge gnarled roots and stones as I made my way several miles just to get to the base.

But, after a really good, strenuous day of hiking, this was the view that I got, well worth it!
