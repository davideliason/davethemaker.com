I've had a number of motorcycles since learning to ride when I was 17 years old, but my favorite so far has been the BMW F650 GS Dakar, a dual-sport warrior of a bike that is bullet-proof and handles on and off road riding very well indeed.

In this trip, in 2008, I took the Dakar out into the high desert for two weeks, camping in dispersed camping ("free is good"), exploring fire trails, and generally having a grand time :)

There's nothing like just having pure, open space. The smell of sage, warmed by the sun. Nobody around for miles. Life seems full of promise..

On the stretch towards Monument Valley. One of my favorite memories and scenes.

Planning the next day, camped near a canyon, boondock camping.
