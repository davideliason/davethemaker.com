At the very end of April, I packed up all of my things, and did some major juggling and organzing while trying to squeeze everything into my car. I was able to do it, everything in a single load - perfect!

I then drove from Portland to Seattle at 2am so as to beat traffic. As rain pelted down on my windshield, I had a number of hours to reflect on what a big change this was for me. It meant leaving a community that felt comfortable for me, with my friends and routines, and stretching out to a completely new environment. Mind you, Seattle is only a few hours north of Portland, but I never seemed to make it up there - Portland really can be pretty comfortable :) To be honest, though, as my departure date neared, there were times that I'd wake up in the middle of the night and feel a lot of fear about the unknown. It wouldn't be just one change or an adjustment, but a complete lifechange.



I shifted my thinking, though, as I remembered just how fortunate I am to have been accepted at this program, and to have the opportunity to learn the kinds of things that I am very interested about. I find coding and cloud computing really, really interesting, and here I have the chance to learn all this in ground zero for all-things-cloud. This is where it's all happening, and I get to live here, breathe it in daily, be surrounded by super smart and passionate people. Seriously, it's humbling.

 In the book, "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck", by Mark Manson, he describes that you have to give a f*ck about something that is more important than the pain that you go through to reach your goals, your dreams. You have to believe in something, care about something deeply, to the point where you won't let embarassment or pain or discomfort stop you for keeping on going. And that really spoke to me, because taking on student debt, moving to a new place, making new friends, learning new skills - well, it's all helping me to realize my goals of being able to make really good, interesting, helpful stuff using tech and code. I believe in it, I believe in this, and so any discomfort is worth it. It's not comfortable, but life isn't comfortable, it's painful, and I want to be the kind of person who doesn't let the thought of pain scare me away from taking a chance or putting that next foot forward.

So that's my new thinking now, and while I'm still working on making that shift to where it comes to curling weights and jogging daily (which is also painful, but I know it will help me to get in shape), it's a remaking of my mind.

So, this is a new beginning for me - a new community, and new program, and a new way of thinking. It's a new me, which feels good, a chance to reframe the way that I see myself, letting go of past disappointments and reframing them as painful, yes, very painful experiences but which have value in showing me that I can still push through and keep going. And that makes me feel stronger.
