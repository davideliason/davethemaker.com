I love getting into the high desert, with the wide open spaces, room to camp, hike, and breathe without anybody else around, typically for many miles around. Even now, writing this, I can almost smell the sage, and feel the wonder of looking up and seeing so many stars that my eyes begin to tire and, like I normally tend to do, slip into a deep sleep no matter how hard I try to pry my eyes open.  Here, in the space that remembers how big the world is, I think big dreams, forgotten visions of what I planned to do and be, and oftentimes they are rekindled. I come back feeling refreshed and inspired to be as big as what I've seen.

In early April 2019 I went to Utah for two weeks, one of which was bathed in sunshine...

 and the other of which I wrestled with rain, hail, snow, and mud. A bit too early in the season, but it still was an adventure..
